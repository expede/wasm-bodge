A CLI tool for taking wasm-bindgen based Wasm libraries and building an NPM package that works everywhere (well, lots of places).

> **Note:** The problem this tool is solving is tricky, and the things we do to solve it are complicated and somewhat fragile. It's best to have a full understanding of what exactly is being done in order to be able to debug things effectively. Please read the full README.

## TL;DR

**What it does:** Takes a Rust crate using `wasm-bindgen` and produces a universal NPM package.

Basically you do this inside your rust crate:

```bash
wasm-bodge build
```

And now you have a ready to publish NPM package.

**Supported environments:**
- Node.js (ESM and CommonJS)
- Browsers (with bundlers like Webpack, Vite, Rollup)
- Browsers (without bundlers, via base64-embedded wasm)
- Cloudflare Workers (workerd)
- Script tags (IIFE)

**Key exports:**

The package produced by `wasm-bodge` provides the following subpath exports which help with handling WebAssembly initialization in different environments:

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.` | Auto-detected environment entry point |
| `./slim` | Manual initialization (for library authors) |
| `./wasm` | Raw `.wasm` file |
| `./wasm-base64` | Base64-encoded wasm |
| `./iife` | IIFE bundle for `<script>` tags |

## Quickstart

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust with wasm32-unknown-unknown target, wasm-bindgen-cli, wasm-opt, esbuild

# Build your wasm crate
wasm-bodge build

# Publish from the directory containing package.json
npm publish
```

Your users can then import it anywhere:

```javascript
import { myFunction } from "my-wasm-lib"
```

## CLI Reference

```
wasm-bodge build [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--crate-path <PATH>` | `.` (current dir) | Path to the Rust crate directory |
| `--package-json <PATH>` | `./package.json` | Path to template package.json |
| `--out-dir <PATH>` | `./dist` | Output directory for generated files |
| `--release-profile <PROFILE>` | `release` | Cargo profile for the release variant (alias: `--profile`) |
| `--debug-profile <PROFILE>` | (none) | Passing this flag builds a parallel `/debug` variant using the named profile |
| `--wasm-bindgen-tar <PATH>` | (none) | Use prebuilt wasm-bindgen output from tarball |
| `--no-wasm-opt` | `false` | Skip wasm-opt optimization |

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- `wasm-bindgen-cli` (`cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`)
- `wasm-opt` (`cargo install wasm-opt`) — disable with `--no-wasm-opt`
- `esbuild` (`npm install -g esbuild` or local install)

### Debug builds

Passing `--debug-profile <name>` produces a parallel `./debug` subpath export compiled under the named cargo profile. With the recommended `inherits = "dev"` profile below, the `/debug` artifacts have DWARF for browser devtools, runtime debug assertions, arithmetic overflow checks, and a low `opt-level` that keeps variable scopes and line numbers intact. The release variant is untouched.

The named profile must exist in the authoritative `Cargo.toml`: the standalone crate's manifest, or the workspace root's manifest for workspace members (cargo reads `[profile.*]` only from the workspace root and silently ignores profile tables in member manifests). Recommended snippet:

```toml
[profile.wasm-debug]
inherits = "dev"
debug = "full"
opt-level = 0
strip = "none"
```

Then invoke: `wasm-bodge build --debug-profile wasm-debug`.

wasm-bodge runs two independent `cargo build` invocations — one with `--release-profile` (default `release`), one with `--debug-profile` — and feeds each to `wasm-bindgen` independently. `wasm-opt` is only applied to the release wasm.

If the named profile is not declared, wasm-bodge fails with an error pointing you at the snippet above. `--debug-profile release` gives you a debug variant with DWARF but without the debug assertions, low opt-level, or overflow checks of a `dev`-inherited profile.

## The Problem

The output of `wasm-bindgen` is not a JavaScript package that can be loaded in any environment.

Writing WebAssembly libraries in Rust is generally achieved using the `wasm-bindgen` toolchain. Using `wasm-bindgen` involves three steps:

1. Write code in Rust annotated with the `wasm-bindgen` macros
2. Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly using `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
3. Use the `wasm-bindgen` CLI tool to generate JavaScript and WebAssembly files from the compiled Wasm

Here's an example. Say we have a Rust crate called `my-rust-crate` with this code:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(left: u32, right: u32) -> u32 {
    left + right
}
```

To build this for Node.js we first compile it for the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Then, we use `wasm-bindgen` to generate the JS and Wasm files:

```bash
wasm-bindgen --target nodejs --out-dir ./out ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_rust_crate.wasm
```

This generates output in `./out`:

```
out/
  my_rust_crate.d.ts
  my_rust_crate.js
  my_rust_crate_bg.wasm
  my_rust_crate_bg.wasm.d.ts
```

The `.d.ts` files are TypeScript declarations. The `.js` file contains JavaScript glue code that provides a nice interface to the WebAssembly module. We can import it like so:

```javascript
import { add } from "./out/my_rust_crate.js";
add(1, 2);
```

To make this into a package, we create a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-wasm-lib",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "out/my_rust_crate.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./out/my_rust_crate.js"
  }
}
```

This works in Node.js:

```javascript
import { add } from "my-wasm-lib";
add(1, 2);
```

**But it fails in Deno:**

```
> deno
Deno 2.6.5
> let { add } = await import("my-wasm-lib")
Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at file:///tmp/wat/my-rust-crate/dist/my_rust_crate.js:12:1
```

The problem is that `--target nodejs` produces CommonJS modules, but Deno only supports ES Modules. We could use `--target deno`, but then Node.js wouldn't work.

**This is the core problem wasm-bodge solves.**

## How wasm-bodge Solves It

The solution is to:

1. Bundle all the different wasm-bindgen strategies into the package
2. Use subpath exports to choose the right strategy for the current environment
3. Provide an escape hatch for environments where detection doesn't work

### Subpath Exports

Subpath exports are a `package.json` feature that allows different entry points for different environments:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "import": "./esm/index.js",
    "require": "./cjs/index.js"
  }
}
```

This tells the module resolver to use `./esm/index.js` for ES Module `import` statements, and `./cjs/index.js` for CommonJS `require` calls.

We can be more specific with "conditional exports":

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "node": {
      "import": "./esm/node.js",
      "require": "./cjs/node.js"
    },
    "browser": "./esm/browser.js"
  }
}
```

The module resolver picks the most specific match for the current environment. Which conditions are supported depends on the environment and is generally not well standardized or documented - that's why this approach is fragile and why we need an escape hatch.

### Shared Web Target Architecture

A key design decision in wasm-bodge is that every entry point ultimately re-exports
from the same `wasm-bindgen --target web` output module. The web target generates a
module-level `let wasm;` variable that all binding functions reference, and exports an
`initSync(bytes)` function that populates it. Because ES modules are singletons, any
code that imports from `wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js` shares this `wasm` variable.

This means that if the root export (`.`) initializes the wasm module, the slim export
(`./slim`) automatically becomes functional too — they're both backed by the same
underlying module. This is the property that makes it safe for library authors to
import from `/slim` while their consumers import from the root.

Each environment just differs in *how* it obtains the wasm bytes and calls `initSync`:

| Environment | How wasm is loaded | Init mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | `fs.readFileSync` from disk | `initSync(bytes)` |
| Browser (no bundler) | Base64-encoded in JS | `initSync(bytes)` |
| Bundler (Webpack, Vite) | Bundler's native `.wasm` import | `__wbg_set_wasm(exports)` shim |
| Cloudflare Workers | Synchronous wasm module import | `initSync({ module })` |
| Slim | User-provided | User calls `initSync` |

For CJS, a shared `cjs/web-bindings.cjs` bundle (built by esbuild from the web target)
serves the same role. Both `cjs/node.cjs` and `cjs/slim.cjs` `require()` this bundle,
and Node's require cache ensures they share the same module instance.

### Environment-Specific Strategies

`wasm-bodge` creates entrypoint scripts for each supported environment. Each entrypoint
initializes wasm using whatever mechanism is available in that environment, then
re-exports from the shared web target module.

---

#### Node.js

The Node.js entrypoint reads the wasm binary from disk using `node:fs` and calls
`initSync` on the web target.

**ES Module Entrypoint** (`./dist/esm/node.js`):
```javascript
import { initSync } from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { dirname, join } from 'node:path';
const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
initSync(readFileSync(join(__dirname, '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>_bg.wasm')));
export * from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
```

**CommonJS Entrypoint** (`./dist/cjs/node.cjs`):
```javascript
const bindings = require('./web-bindings.cjs');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
bindings.initSync(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>_bg.wasm')));
module.exports = bindings;
```

---

#### Browsers (without bundler)

Browsers don't support importing `.wasm` directly, and we don't know what URL the wasm
will be served from, so we embed the wasm as base64 in the JS file.

We use `--target web` and add a build step that base64-encodes the `.wasm` file into
`wasm-base64.js`.

**ES Module Entrypoint** (`./dist/esm/web.js`):
```javascript
import { initSync } from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
import { wasmBase64 } from './wasm-base64.js';
const bytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(wasmBase64), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
initSync(bytes);
export * from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
```

**CommonJS Entrypoint** (`./dist/cjs/web.cjs`):
Bundled from the ESM entrypoint using `esbuild --format=cjs`.

---

#### Bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Rollup, etc.)

Bundlers can handle `.wasm` imports natively, so we use the bundler target's wasm
loading mechanism. However, we still re-export from the web target so that bundler and
slim share the same wasm state.

The shim imports the raw wasm from the `--target bundler` output (which the bundler
knows how to resolve), then injects the resulting wasm exports into the web target's
bindings via a post-processed `__wbg_set_wasm` export.

**ES Module Entrypoint** (`./dist/esm/bundler.js`):
```javascript
import { __wbg_set_wasm as __bundler_set_wasm } from '../wasm_bindgen/bundler/<lib name>_bg.js';
import * as wasmExports from '../wasm_bindgen/bundler/<lib name>_bg.wasm';
import { __wbg_set_wasm } from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
__bundler_set_wasm(wasmExports);
wasmExports.__wbindgen_start();
__wbg_set_wasm(wasmExports);
export * from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
```

The bundler target's `__wbg_set_wasm` must be called first because `__wbindgen_start()`
invokes wasm imports that reference the bundler target's internal `wasm` variable.

**CommonJS Entrypoint** (`./dist/cjs/bundler.cjs`):
Falls back to the base64 web entrypoint since CommonJS can't import `.wasm` directly.

---

#### Cloudflare Workers (workerd)

Cloudflare Workers allow synchronous `.wasm` imports but still need JS wrapper
initialization.

**ES Module Entrypoint** (`./dist/esm/workerd.js`):
```javascript
import * as exports from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
import { initSync } from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
import wasmModule from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>_bg.wasm';
initSync({ module: wasmModule });
export * from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
```

**CommonJS Entrypoint** (`./dist/cjs/workerd.cjs`):
Falls back to the base64 web entrypoint.

---

#### IIFE (Script Tags)

For `<script>` tag usage in browsers, we bundle the web entrypoint as an IIFE:

```bash
esbuild ./dist/esm/web.js --bundle --format=iife --global-name=MyWasmLib
```

Usage:
```html
<script src="path/to/my-wasm-lib/dist/iife/index.js"></script>
<script>
  MyWasmLib.myFunction();
</script>
```

---

### The `/slim` Escape Hatch

Despite our best efforts, some environments won't work with automatic detection. The
`/slim` export provides manual initialization:

```javascript
import { initSync, myFunction } from "my-wasm-lib/slim";
import wasmBytes from "my-wasm-lib/wasm";
const bytes = /* fetch or read wasmBytes as appropriate */;
initSync(bytes);
// Now use the exports
myFunction();
```

**This is important for library authors.** If you're writing a library that depends on a
wasm-bodge package, import from `/slim`. This avoids bundling a wasm initialization
strategy that may not work in your consumer's environment.

Because all entry points share the same underlying web target module, a consuming
application can import from the root export (which auto-initializes) and your library's
`/slim` import will automatically become functional — no coordination needed.

**ES Module Entrypoint** (`./dist/esm/slim.js`):
```javascript
export * from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
export { default } from '../wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js';
```

**CommonJS Entrypoint** (`./dist/cjs/slim.cjs`):
```javascript
module.exports = require('./web-bindings.cjs');
```

The web target doesn't auto-initialize and exports `initSync` for manual initialization.

## Build Output

`wasm-bodge` outputs a `./dist` directory with this structure:

```
dist/
    esm/
        node.js           # Node.js ESM (fs.readFileSync + initSync)
        web.js            # Browser (base64 embedded + initSync)
        bundler.js        # Bundler shim (__wbg_set_wasm)
        workerd.js        # Cloudflare Workers (sync wasm import)
        slim.js           # Manual initialization (re-export only)
        wasm-base64.js    # Base64-encoded wasm
    cjs/
        node.cjs          # Node.js CommonJS
        web.cjs           # Browser CommonJS (bundled from ESM)
        slim.cjs          # Manual init CommonJS
        web-bindings.cjs  # Shared web target bundle (used by node.cjs + slim.cjs)
        wasm-base64.cjs   # Base64 CommonJS
    iife/
        index.js          # IIFE bundle for <script> tags
    wasm_bindgen/
        nodejs/           # wasm-bindgen --target nodejs (used for .d.ts)
        web/              # wasm-bindgen --target web (shared by all entry points)
        bundler/          # wasm-bindgen --target bundler (wasm loading only)
    index.d.ts            # TypeScript declarations
    <package-name>.wasm   # Raw wasm file
```

The `package.json` exports are configured as:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "workerd": {
        "import": "./dist/esm/workerd.js",
        "require": "./dist/cjs/web.cjs"
      },
      "node": {
        "import": "./dist/esm/node.js",
        "require": "./dist/cjs/node.cjs"
      },
      "browser": {
        "import": "./dist/esm/bundler.js",
        "require": "./dist/cjs/web.cjs"
      },
      "import": "./dist/esm/web.js",
      "require": "./dist/cjs/web.cjs"
    },
    "./slim": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/esm/slim.js",
      "require": "./dist/cjs/slim.cjs"
    },
    "./wasm": "./dist/<package-name>.wasm",
    "./wasm-base64": {
      "import": "./dist/esm/wasm-base64.js",
      "require": "./dist/cjs/wasm-base64.cjs"
    },
    "./iife": "./dist/iife/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### WebAssembly Initialization

Why does `wasm-bindgen` have different targets? They all handle WebAssembly initialization
differently.

The standard WebAssembly API is imperative:

```javascript
const wasmBytes = await fetch("my_module.wasm").then(res => res.arrayBuffer());
const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBytes, importObject);
```

We want users to import our library like any other JS module, so we need to hide this
initialization. The `--target web` output from wasm-bindgen generates binding functions
that reference a module-level `let wasm;` variable, and exports an `initSync(bytes)`
function that compiles and instantiates the wasm module, populating that variable.

wasm-bodge exploits the fact that ES modules are singletons: if two entry points both
import from the same `wasm_bindgen/web/<lib name>.js` file, they share the same `wasm`
variable. Each environment-specific entry point just needs to obtain the wasm bytes
through whatever mechanism is available (filesystem read, base64 decode, bundler import,
etc.) and call `initSync`. Once any entry point has initialized, all other entry points
that import from the same web target module are also functional.

The bundler environment is a special case. Bundlers handle `.wasm` imports natively via
the `--target bundler` output, which uses `import * as wasm from './<lib>_bg.wasm'`.
Rather than duplicating the wasm instantiation logic, the bundler shim lets the bundler
load the wasm through its normal mechanism, then injects the resulting exports into the
web target's bindings via `__wbg_set_wasm` (a function we add to the web target during
post-processing). This way the bundler handles wasm loading optimally while still sharing
state with `/slim`.

### Fixing Vite's Asset Preprocessor

Vite's asset scanner looks for patterns like:

```javascript
new URL("./<path>", import.meta.url)
```

The `--target web` output contains this pattern, which can cause Vite to bundle multiple copies of the wasm file.

We add a `/* @vite-ignore */` comment (undocumented usage, may break) inside the expression:

```javascript
new /* @vite-ignore */ URL('./my_lib_bg.wasm', import.meta.url);
```

The comment must be inside the `new URL(...)` because Vite:
1. Uses a regex to match `new URL(...)` patterns
2. Searches each match for `/* @vite-ignore */`
